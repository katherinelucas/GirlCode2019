# GirlCode Raspberry Pi Workshops held by KU Women in Computing 2019-2020
This is a repository for all of the code and projects related to each GirlCode session hosted from Fall 2019-Spring 2020. Each project will be written with Python and using a Raspberry Pi.

Project 1: This session will teach some of the basics of using Minecraft on a Raspberry Pi. We will use Python to control and alter elements of the game. This project will teach atendees about naming variables, libraries, positions in a game-environment, using-declaration, while loops, sleep functions and if and else statements.

Project 2: This lesson will teach atendees about how to encode and decode secret messages using a cypher. This will be accomplished using libraries, using-declaration, if and else statements, priting and loops.

Project 3: This workshop will guide girls through the creation of an interactive piano keyboard in Minecraft using Sonic Pi, user coordinates, for loops, function delcarations and while loops.

Project 4: This project will allow selfies taken via a camera on the Pi to be generated into pixel blocks in Minecraft. This project will teach nested for loops, if and else statements, arrays, finding user's coordinates and function declarations.
