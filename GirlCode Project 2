The alphabet starts from a which we will make as 0
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
print (alphabet[0])
print (alphabet[4])

Now we will set our key and find the position from letter entered
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
character=input(‘Please enter a character: ‘)
position=alphabet.find(character)
print(position)

Now we will find its new position
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
character=input(‘Please enter a character: ‘)
position=alphabet.find(character)
print(position)
newposition=position + key
print(newposition)

Now we have our new letter using the encryption
You’ll notice if we put in a letter like ‘y’ it will go over how many letters in the alphabet. To fix this we will add “%26” so it will loop  back to the beginning if this happens
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
character=input(‘Please enter a character: ‘)
position=alphabet.find(character)
print(position)
newposition=(position + key) %26
print(newposition)

Now we will print the new letter at that position
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
character=input(‘Please enter a character: ‘)
position=alphabet.find(character)
print(position)
newposition=(position + key) %26
print(newposition)
newcharacter = alphabet[newposition]
print(newcharacter)

Now we will clean it up nicer
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
character=input(‘Please enter a character: ‘)
position=alphabet.find(character)
newposition=(position + key) %26
newcharacter = alphabet[newposition]
print(‘The new character is: ‘, newcharacter)

Now we will encrypt a whole new line.
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
message=input(‘Please enter a message: ‘)
for character in message:
position=alphabet.find(character)
newposition=(position + key) %26
newcharacter = alphabet[newposition]
print(‘The new character is: ‘, newcharacter)

This will put your code into a cypher letter by letter. We can also print the message as it’s being encrypted.
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
newmessage = ‘ ’
message=input(‘Please enter a message: ‘)
for character in message:
position=alphabet.find(character)
newposition=(position + key) %26
newcharacter = alphabet[newposition]
print(‘The new character is: ‘, newcharacter)
	newmessage += newcharacter
	print(newmessage)

We can also have it displayed only at the end
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
Newmessage = ‘ ’
message=input(‘Please enter a message: ‘)
for character in message:
position=alphabet.find(character)
newposition=(position + key) %26
newcharacter = alphabet[newposition]
	newmessage += newcharacter
print(“Your new message is ‘, newmessage)

We also want to make it so that only the letters are encrypted, not things like ‘!’s. To do that we can use
alphabet = ‘abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz’
key=3
Newmessage = ‘ ’
message=input(‘Please enter a message: ‘)
for character in message:
	if character in alphabet:
position=alphabet.find(character)
newposition=(position + key) %26
newcharacter = alphabet[newposition]
		newmessage += newcharacter
	else:
		newmessage += character
print(“Your new message is ‘, newmessage)
