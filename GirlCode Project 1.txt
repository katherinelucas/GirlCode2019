First click on the manilla folder at the top, and create a new file anywhere called anything as long as it ends in .py, Iâ€™ll call mine game.py
Click on the raspberry in the top left corner, mouse down to games, and click open Minecraft Pi
Click Start Game then Create New
To get control of your mouse, hit tab or the escape button to pause the game, to make the screen bigger adjust the black box behind it with arrows and WASD to move around and E to pull up inventory

To begin, first we will start by posting a comment to chat. In your file, type
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
mc.postToChat("GirlCode Rocks!)

Now, we find get our position in the first step to teleport
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
Your position will appear in the top left of your minecraft screen

To teleport
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
mc.player.setPos(x, y+100, z)
If you edit y and z too high at the same time, the game will be overwhelmed

Now set a block
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
mc.setBlock(x+1, y, z, 1)
Where 1 is what type of block it is grass is 2 dirt is 3 for example!

We can also write it in a way that is more clear
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos() 
dirt = 3
mc.setBlock(x+1, y, z, dirt)

We can also change the color of the block this way 
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
wool = 35
mc.setBlock(x+1, y, z, wool, 2)
Other numbers in the last column will give you different numbers!

You can also make one big huge chunk of stone
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos() 
stone = 1
mc.setBlocks(x, y, z,x+10, y+10, z+10, stone)
To make a 10x10x10 block of stone

We can also make a block of exploding tnt in the game. Without adding the ",1" after tnt, the cube will not explode
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
tnt = 46
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, tnt, 1)

To make a large cube of explosions, how might we use what we did before with the stone with this block of tnt?
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
tnt = 46
mc.setBlocks(x, y, z,x+4, y+4, z+4, tnt, 1)

Now we will make flowers appear behind us every step we walk!
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
from time import sleep
mc = Minecraft.create()
flower = 38
while True:
	x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
	mc.setBlock(x, y, z, flower)
	sleep (.1)
To stop it hit control c

Now we make it run only when we are standing on grass. Our first step will be so our program can read what we are standing on to identify it's grass or not.
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
from time import sleep
mc = Minecraft.create()
flower = 38
grass = 2
while True:
	x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
	block_beneath = mc.getBlock(x, y-1, z)
	print(block_beneath)
Now stop the program.

Now we will make it so only flowers appear if it is grass
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
from time import sleep
mc = Minecraft.create()
flower = 38
while True:
	x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
	block_beneath = mc.getBlock(x, y-1, z)
	if block_beneath == grass:
		mc.setBlock(x, y, z, flower)
	else:
		mc.setBlock(x, y-1, z, grass)	

Now we can have fun with lava
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
lava = 10
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, lava) 

--------------------------------------------------------------
If time in session, play with lava cooling settings. See what happens when lava cools down!
from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
from time import sleep
mc = Minecraft.create()
x, y, z = mc.player.getPos()
lava = 5
water = 3
air = 0
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, lava)
sleep(6)
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, water)
sleep(3)
mc.setBlock(x, y, z, air)
